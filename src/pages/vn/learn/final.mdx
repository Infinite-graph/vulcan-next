# Congratulations!

**Congratulations, you went through all steps of the "Learn" section!**

This should be enough to get you started with Vulcan Next.
However, creating a full-fledged web application is more complicated than plugging
a Mongo database and writing a few models.

We strongly advise to join our Slack. You'll meet a community of developers
that strive to create the best web applications, just like you!
