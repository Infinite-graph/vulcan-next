# Step 1: Opening Vulcan locally

Great, you have installed and started Vulcan on your own machine!

The "`localhost`" in the url means that Vulcan Next is currently running on your own computer,
litterally the "local host".

This is all you have to do for this step. Next step is going to be about the database.

## Go to step 2

<NextMuiButton href="/learn/mongo" variant="contained">
  Click to go to next step
</NextMuiButton>

export default function IntroOfflinePage(props) {
  return <LearnLayout {...props} />;
}
